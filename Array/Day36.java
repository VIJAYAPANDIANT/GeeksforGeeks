/*Parenthesis Checker
Given a string s, composed of different combinations of '(' , ')', '{', '}', '[', ']'. Determine whether the Expression is balanced or not.
An expression is balanced if:

Each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket of the same type.
Opening brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Examples :

Input: s = "[{()}]"
Output: true
Explanation: All the brackets are well-formed.
Input: s = "[()()]{}"
Output: true
Explanation: All the brackets are well-formed.
Input: s = "([]"
Output: false
Explanation: The expression is not balanced as there is a missing ')' at the end.
Input: s = "([{]})"
Output: false
Explanation: The expression is not balanced as there is a closing ']' before the closing '}'. */
